# Algorithm problems #
---

This is a collection of small ideas. Small algorithms that solve small problems, maybe sometimes can be useful.

**anagrams.py:**

It examines two words and decides whether the two words are anagrams of each other or not.
During the analysis, the special characters will be removed and the two words will be converted to lowercase, since for anagram purposes, uppercase and lowercase letters do not matter.

**arrayChunk.py:**

This algorithm It expects two parameters, an array and a number. It returns with an array that contains as many subarrays as we gave it

**averageWordLength.py**

It is coming soon.

** reverseInt.py **

Wait an integer and returns the integer with the digits reversed. If the number entered was negative, the number returned will also be negative.
